I took several of the GrafxKid classic hero edits and transformed them to an isometric projection (dimetric) on a 32x32 grid.

Eight animated characters with idle, walk, attack, and hit animation frames (though several animations could probably use a few additional frames and tweaks). Up and down facing directions are included.

I am also including a tileset made using the DB32 palette, that includes grass, desert, stone, water, and wood tiles, as well as a few props (birds are adapted from Refuzzle: https://opengameart.org/content/winter-birds ). The tiles also include shadows that can be layered to mimic decent ambient occlusion.
