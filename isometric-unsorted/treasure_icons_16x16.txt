Looking at my first 16x16 treasure icons i started to feel the need for some more "modern style" ones, especially in terms of colors.

The result: 13 different icons in copper, silver and gold. I myself am using the first three rows in a game project with a "1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, ..." value system, ending at 500000 represented by the gold ingot.

I hope you like these as much as i do and find a use for them! :)
