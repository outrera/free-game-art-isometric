this is the second part of isometric graphics.

my first version was

http://opengameart.org/content/10-free-isometric-graphics-from-3d-models

it contains now textures (i forgot it in the first version), blend-file and 61 isometric graphics, so i added the parts from version 1 (stones + mushrooms)

it has now better shadows (transparency)

i used these cc0 submissions: (thanks to all who subbmitted these art under cc0)
