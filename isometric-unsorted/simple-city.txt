I am currently working on a low resolution set of tiles for a city builder. Although I have not finished it yet, I want to update this as I go along with creating the new tiles.

Feedback is welcome! Please note that I do not consider myself an artist, and that I am actually a programmer who just thought they'd save budget making their own graphics.
