Today, I'd like to share with you something special, holds a very nostalgic feeling to me.

This is one of the very first (if not THE first) ever serious scene I created. Back in the first week I started with 3d, I think it was 6 or 8 years ago. I wasn't even freelaning yet, it was mostly a hobby.

Pretty sure it was created with Anim8or (any of you remember that?) that's how old it is.

The sprites are all 32x32 size.
