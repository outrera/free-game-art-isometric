Mystic Mine is now Open Source
==============================

All source code and content of Mystic Mine (http://www.mysticmine.com) is now
released under the MIT license (see LICENSE.txt for more info). This includes:
- All source code (mainly written in python)
- All graphics (Blender 3D and Gimp files included)

Unfortunately the music and sound of the original game were bought under a
royalty free license, and so they cannot be distributed here. Currently all
those files are silent. I hope someone can find a proper replacement for these
sounds and music files, so that the Open Source release of Mystic Mine becomes
a complete game.

In the meantime you can always get the original sound and music files when
buying the original game at http://www.mysticmine.com, but you cannot
redistribute them (so for personal use only).


Why did I make this game Open Source?
-------------------------------------

Plenty of people have mailed me with the request to port Mystic Mine to some
platform X (because that would be really cool!). Or to distribute Mystic Mine
where it's currently not available. But the sad truth is that I can't
put much energy in Mystic Mine because I'm focussing on another project
(http://rpgplayground.com). I feel sad about this, because it would indeed be
cool if Mystic Mine received more attention.

Therefore I decided to release Mystic Mine as Open Source, both the source code
and as much content as possible. 

Commercially I don't have much to gain from this, but there's a huge list of
things that would make me very happy:
- My fans creating their own levels (There's an ingame level editor that my
  friends and I used to create all those levels. Check the sources for hidden
  keyboard shortcuts).
- Modifications, adaptions and improvements that I would never have thought of
  myself.
- sudo aptitute install mysticmine
- Mystic Mine running on all kinds of different platforms.
- The Open Source community receiving something back from me. As you probably
  know I'm a huge fan of Open Source. Mystic Mine was created on Linux using
  python, pygame, gVim, Blender 3D, The Gimp, Audacity, ... . After receiving
  so much, it makes me happy to give something small back.

Enjoy, and have fun!
