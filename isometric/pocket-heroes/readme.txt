Pocket Heroes is an original turn-based strategy for handheld devices, that is made in the style and feel of the old-school "Heroes of Might and Magic" game. Pocket Heroes plunges you into the atmosphere of exciting fantasy adventures, and epic battles! Lead your heroes as a barbarian orc chief, a noble knight, a mighty wizard, a fast beautiful sorceress, a warlock, or a creepy undead necromancer! As your kingdom grows in size, and your heroes get more powerful, you will discover new places, learn new skills and magic, and fight different monsters! This project is Freeware and Open Source .
