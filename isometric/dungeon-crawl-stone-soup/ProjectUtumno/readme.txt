In addition to the 3000+ original tiles, here are 3000+ MORE tiles used in the game Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/

The great artists of the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup team have recently enhanced and added to the already-amazing set with this supplemental collection of tiles: even more spells, effects, monsters, items, GUI elements, player avatars, terrain, and dungeon features.

All images are 2D 32x32 pixel tiles in orthogonal (overhead) three-quarters  perspective.

- Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Supplemental.zip file contains the latest addition of 3000+ tiles. The tiles are individual 32x32 sprite .png files organized into folder categories. See https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles for the original set of tiles these are meant to supplement.
- Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Full.zip file contains both the first set plus this newer addition for a total of over 6000 tiles! The tiles are individual 32x32 sprite .png files organized into folder categories.
- ProjectUtumno_supplemental.png file is the same 3000+ found in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Supplemental.zip, but arranged in a nice (huge) tileset.
- ProjectUtumno_full.png file is the same 6000+ found in Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup Full.zip, but arranged in a nice (huger) tileset.

Have you ever played Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup? You should. Seriously, it's a great game. These tiles are a collaborative effort of many artists. See README.TXT included in the .zip files for a full list of the contributors.
