Hello there,

I wanted to get some freespace on my harddrive and noticed we are not using the following sprites for our project, so I thought someone else might want them or can benefit from them.
The Preview is a file for male dashing, not all files are in this fashion since we noticed at one point that we want to go into a diffrent direction.
So some sprites have no heads and so on.
I would have wanted to include more files into the preview but figured that the viewability would suffer from it.

The download includes:

    casting_Male (headless)
    damaged_Male (headless)
    dashing_Male (with and without heads)
    eyes1 (basically eyes blinking)
    feeding_Male (with and without heads)
    Heads (with and without eyes)
    Item_Male (headless) 
    walking_Male (headless) 

I hope the preview is not misleading and you can maybe make any use of these.
Wish you a nice day and good luck with your own projects! :)
