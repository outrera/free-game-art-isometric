Sprite set of a spaceship that has been used in the prototype of the 2.5D isometric space game: Space Pioneer (www.trikiminut.com)

This was used only for the prototype, and will not be used in the final game. I encourage use of the sprites for your own prototyping, or game itself.

The set is 16 directional isometric, with each sprite being 256px X 256px in dimensions.
